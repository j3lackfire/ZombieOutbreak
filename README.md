# ZombieOutbreak

A game about shooting evil zombies. I was inspired about alien shooter, so I wanted to make a similar game but more cute.

I really hate the onscreen joy-stick that is presented in every mobile game ever, so I wanted to do it differently. 

Tap anywhere to move, and if you hold the aim button, then it's tap anywhere to shoot. It's good on PC but not very good on mobile since your finger get in the place of everything.
